Event-Driven Architecture System (FastAPI & Redis)
Overview of this project : 

This project is a backend-only Event-Driven Architecture system built using FastAPI and Redis, designed to simulate a scalable food delivery platform. It enables asynchronous communication between services using events for better performance and loose coupling.

Features :

Event-driven backend architecture using Redis

RESTful APIs built with FastAPI

Asynchronous event publishing and processing

Scalable and loosely coupled system design
